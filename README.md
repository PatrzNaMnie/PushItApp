# PushItApp
##### Version: Beta v0.1
#
#

## Overview
##### PushItApp is a mobile application that helps you complete the Push Up Challenge
##### What's is Push Up Challenge? It's a challenge invented by me. The rules are simple, you should do exactly as many push-ups as there are days in a year in total.
##### This can be done in two ways. Do it day by day or in proportional way. You find more information in User Manual. Enjoy ;)
